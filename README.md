# CallAutomation.Extensions

An extension library using the 'fluent API' style for the Azure Communication Services Call Automation platform making it easier to invoke actions and correlate callbacks to functions at runtime.

## Setup and configuration

In your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` (for .NET 6 or greater), simply add the following line of code.

```csharp
// .NET 6 or higher
builder.Services
    .AddCallAutomationClient(builder.Configuration["ConnectionString"])
    .AddCallAutomationEventHandling();
```

This will register the `CallAutomationClient` as a singleton in .NET's dependency injection container along with the necessary back-end services and a publisher `ICallAutomationEventPublisher` you can use to publish the Webhook callbacks.

## Handling the Webhook callbacks

The Azure Communication Services Call Automation platform uses Webhook callbacks to an HTTPS endpoint you specify when creating a call or answering a call. The format for these callbacks is a `CloudEvent` collection and this library includes a simple publisher used to locate the correct callback handler to invoke to correlate the previous action.

```csharp
// .NET 6 or higher minimal API example
app.MapPost("/api/callbacks", async (CloudEvent[] events, ICallAutomationEventPublisher publisher) => 
    await publisher.PublishAsync(events));
```

## Outbound calling

The outbound calling experience is greatly simplified into a series of chained methods which lead the developer to the correct conclusion all without having to 'new up' classes or figure out what requirements you need to meet.

### Calling another Azure Communication Services user

```csharp

// inject the CallAutomationClient
await client
        .Call<CommunicationUserIdentifier>("[ACS_USER_ID]")
        .From("[YOUR_APP_ID]")
        .WithCallbackUri("https://yourwebserver.com/path")
        .ExecuteAsync();
```

### Calling a PSTN number

Since calling to the PSTN requires you to specify a source caller ID number, the API leads you to add this property as a requirement when the called party is a `PhoneNumberIdentifier` type.

```csharp

// inject the CallAutomationClient
await client
        .Call<PhoneNumberIdentifier>("+14255551212", x => x.SourceCallerIdNumber = "+18005551212")
        .From("[YOUR_APP_ID]")
        .WithCallbackUri("https://yourwebserver.com/path")
        .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Playing audio

The Call Automation platform currently supports playing audio file from a URI. The file must be recorded in 16Khz, mono, and a WAV file format.

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/call", async ([FromBody] CallRequest callRequest, CallAutomationClient client) =>
{
    await client
        .Call<PhoneNumberIdentifier>("+14255551212", x => x.SourceCallerIdNumber = "+18005551212")
        .From("8:acs:[YOUR_RESOURCE_ID]_[GUID]")
        .WithCallbackUri("https://yourwebserver.com/api/callbacks")
        .OnCallConnected(async (callConnected, callConnection, callMedia, callRecording) =>
        {
            await callMedia
                .Play(x => x.FileUrl = builder.Configuration["Prompt"])
                .OnPlayCompleted(async () => await callConnection.HangUpAsync())
                .ExecuteAsync();
        })
        .ExecuteAsync();
});
```

## Collecting single-digit DTMF input and IVR menus

The library currently supports collecting single digit DTMF input only. Future support for this library to handle multi-tone DTMF input is coming soon. The base Call Automation SDK can be used to perform this type of recognition behavior.

You can use the `OnCallConnected` method to capture the delegate you wish to invoke when this behavior occurs. Additionally, you can do the same for things like `OnPlayCompleted`, and most importantly, when a person presses a key to emit a DTMF tone on the phone.

The following is a simple scenario involving the following:

1. Answer an incoming call
2. Play a greeting
3. Invoke the recognize API to collect a single digit while playing a prompt (Press 1 for English and 2 for Spanish)
4. Invoke the language-specific main menu prompt with DTMF collection (not shown here)

```csharp
await client.Answer(incomingCall)
    .WithCallbackUri("https://yourwebserver.com/api/callbacks")
    .OnCallConnected(async (callConnected, callConnection, callMedia, callRecording) =>
    {
        // play welcome prompt
        await callMedia.Play(x => x.FileUrl = _welcomePrompt)
            .OnPlayCompleted(async () =>
            {
                // language menu
                await callMedia.ReceiveDtmfTone()
                    .FromParticipant(incomingCall.From.RawId)
                    .WithPrompt(_languageSelection)
                    .WithOptions(x =>
                    {
                        x.AllowInterruptExistingMediaOperation = true;
                        x.AllowInterruptPrompt = true;
                        x.WaitForResponseInSeconds = 5;
                    })
                    .OnPress<One>(async () => await MainMenu(_mainMenuEnglish))
                    .OnPress<Two>(async () => await MainMenu(_mainMenuSpanish))
                    .ExecuteAsync();
            })
            .ExecuteAsync();
    })
    .OnCallDisconnected(() =>
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Call disconnected. CorrelationId: {incomingCall.CorrelationId}");
        return ValueTask.CompletedTask;
    })
    .ExecuteAsync();
```
